                        Liquidating a digital asset can be a challenge depending
                        on the government policy, different requirement and
                        procedure of exchanges, withdrawal limitations etc. All
                        this makes the process tiring and expensive. Moreover,
                        the clearing bank, which turns the digital asset into a
                        fiat currency, has its own procedures and fees that it
                        transfers to the customer, adding costs and slowing down
                        the whole process even further. The overall time
                        required to complete the transaction might take a long
                        time, which is inconvenient in situations where the

                        Generally when a person applies for a loan from a credit
                        institution, they perform a credit check. The reason for
                        doing the credit checks is to minimize and mitigate the
                        risks of the institution and to set the limit of the
                        loan and interest rate based on their previous records.
                        This often results in lower limit of loans and higher
                        interest rates.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ComputeEx doesnâ€™t require any credit check to be done
                        before the approval of the loan which will save the time
                        and the hassle in getting the loan approved. As the loan
                        will be secured by the smart contracts both the lending
                        party and the receiving party will be secured.
